# Uber-vs-Lyft-PricePrediction

Data Science Regression Project:

As aspiring Data Scientist, I wanted to interpret different conclusions such as:

Temperature: Whether the number of rides increase with increase in temperature?

Location: Is the price dependent on the source or destination? Are remote rides expensive?

Cab Company:  Which cab company gets more rides? Is it Uber or Lyft. 

Type of Cab: What is the first choice of the cab for long distances? It might be Uber XL for extra comfort and leg space. 

How many other factors depend on the fares of the cab? This is what I would like to analyze using the features in the dataset and also predict which cab company has better prices using regression techniques.
